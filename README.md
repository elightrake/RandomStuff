Curious? Code.


### shuffling_chips.R
I like shuffling poker chips and was fascinated by the pattern in which the chips travel given a perfect shuffle. I coded a simulation of this to try to figure out the pattern -- it is not what you'd expect.


### parlay.R
My friend Nicky likes to bet on basketball lines. I like to code.


### yaniv.Rmd
Took a quick stab at coding up this cool game my friend Manny showed me. play_game() allows you to play the computer in a simplified version of the game using the console. To improve upon: different strategies for computer to play (right now it just plays highest value play), error exists in check_dupes() (considers multiple sets of duplicates as one).
