Curious? Code.


### shuffling_chips.R
I like shuffling poker chips and was fascinated by the pattern in which the chips travel given a perfect shuffle. I coded a simulation of this to try to figure out the pattern -- it is not what you'd expect.


### parlay.R
My friend likes to bet on basketball lines. I like to code.
